Subject: [PATCH 06/19] PCI: keystone: Specify correct alignment requirement

The support for a specific iATU alignment was added in
commit 2a9a801620ef ("PCI: endpoint: Add support to specify alignment for
buffers allocated to BARs").

This commit specifically mentions both that the alignment by each DWC
based EP driver should match CX_ATU_MIN_REGION_SIZE, and that AM65x
specifically has a 64 KB alignment.

This also matches the CX_ATU_MIN_REGION_SIZE value specified by
"12.2.2.4.7 PCIe Subsystem Address Translation" in the AM65x TRM:
https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruid7e/spruid7e.pdf

This higher value, 1 MB, was obviously an ugly hack used to be able to
handle Resizable BARs which have a minimum size of 1 MB.

Now when we actually have support for Resizable BARs, let's configure the
iATU alignment requirement to the actual requirement.
(BARs described as Resizable will still get aligned to 1 MB.)
